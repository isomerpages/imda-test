This entire process could take from 36 hours to 6 months, depending on the size of your site and your own internal process.

Setting up your site
When you’re ready to get onboard Isomer:

Create an account on Github. You can refer to the steps outlined on our guide here
Send us request through this contact form.
We’ll generate a template for you
Submit another form to gain access to your website and start editing on isomerCMS.
Editing your site
To edit your site, you’ll have to log onto IsomerCMS. Before you do that, make sure that you’ve gotten access to your site. Otherwise, you will not see anything after logging in.

Site launch
Let us know in advance (ideally 2 weeks) prior to when you’d like to launch the site. If you need the site to be up urgently, let us know when we’re onboarding you onto isomer so we can slot you in our launch schedule quickly.

You can read more about how to launch your website on our [guide](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/).
