### **FAQ**

**General**</br>
This FAQ section covers only information relating to formatting your content or your site after you're onboarded.
For policy, compliance (IM8), cost, and other questions prior to onboarding to Isomer, please refer to our Official Website FAQ.

**Can I schedule my changes to be published at a specific date/time?** </br>
Isomer does not support embargoing or scheduling of content to be published due to the limitation in the system that we're currently using to host your content, Github.

One workaround you could do is to prepare the content in advance, create a pull request and have it approved, and you can leave the last step of publishing to the time you intend to publish your changes. You can simply log into your Github account on any internet device to publish it.

**I heard of Isomer's free SSL cert service. How do I start using it?**</br>
Yes, we've launched a free SSL cert provisioning service as of 14 October 2020 called IsomerSSL. If your agency is keen on using the free SSL cert, all you have to do is let us know when your agency is ready to launch the site or if you wish to switch from a custom SSL cert to the free SSL cert, you can drop us an email here.

**How much does an SSL cert cost?**</br>
It depends on what SSL cert provider and the type of cert that you purchasing, it could range from $200 to $1000 a year. 

With the recent release of free SSL cert provisioning tool on Isomer, agency can now opt to use free SSL cert issued by Let's Encrypt. Certs are renewed automatically every 3 months.

**Does Isomer support Google Tag Manager (GTM)?**<br>
Unfortunately no. The reason is because the use of GTM violates the Content Security Policy (CSP) we've set up to protect your site from SQL Injection or XXS attacks.

However, you can explore the use of Facebook Pixel, find our more here.
